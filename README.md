## Project Description:

Analyze IoT sensor data with machine learning

## Category: 
IBM Cloud Application

## Skills Required:
Node- RED,IoT Device,IBM IoT Platform,IBM Machine Learning

## Project Description:
According to a study, there will be more than 55 billion IoT devices by 2025, up from about 9 billion in 2017. Machine learning for predictive capabilities is now integrated with most industrial IoT platforms, such as IBM IoT 
For example, if a sensor detects excessive heat or vibration, it triggers an alert. If the same sensor is connected to the internet, then the data encountered by the sensor can also be leveraged to draw more insights and perform analytics for future use.
In this project, you need to build a model for sensor data using Auto AI and build a web application that is integrated to the model built. Any anomaly predicted from the sensor data coming from the IoT platform is displayed on the Web App

## Services Used:

    IBM Watson Studio
    IBM Watson Machine Learning
    Node-RED
    IBM Cloud Object Storage
    IBM IoT Platform
